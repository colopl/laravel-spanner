# v5.1.0 (Not released yet)

Added
- Added `Connection::runDdlBatch` which runs DDLs in batch synchronously. (#86)
- Added emulator support for `Connection::listSessions`. (#88)

Fixed
- Fixed bug where running `Connection::statement` with DDLs was not logging and was not triggering events. (#86)

Changed
- Use google-cloud-php's CacheSessionPool since the [concerned bug](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/issues/5567) has been fixed in [v1.53](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php-spanner/releases/tag/v1.58.2). (#90)
- Separate session pool and authentication per connection so transaction works properly. (#89)

# v5.0.0

updated composer.json to only support laravel 10

Fixed
- `Connection::reconnectIfMissingConnection` was changed from `protected` to `public` to match laravel 10. (#77)
- [Query/Expression](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/upgrade#database-expressions) changed from `(string)$expr` to `$expr->getValue($grammar)`. (#77)
- Applied [QueryException constructor change](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/upgrade#query-exception-constructor) to `Schema/Grammar`. (#77)

Changed
- Checks that primary key is defined in schema and throws an exception if not defined. (#58)
- `Colopl\Spanner\Session` has been renamed to `Colopl\Spanner\SessionInfo`.
- `Blueprint::stringArray`'s `$length` parameter is now optional and defaults to `255`.
- Auth and session pool no longer use the custom FileCacheAdapter and uses Symfony's FilesystemAdapter instead. (#63)
- Path for auth and session pool files have moved from `storage/framework/cache/spanner` to `storage/framework/spanner/{auth|session}`. (#63)
- Default Session Not Found Error Mode was changed from `MAINTAIN_SESSION_POOL` to `CLEAR_SESSION_POOL` (wasn't fully confident at the time, but I think it should be safe to assume it's working now).
- Schema\Builder::getAllTables() now returns rows with `name` and `type` fields instead of list of strings (was implemented incorrectly). (#73)
- Exception previously thrown in `Query/Builder` for `sharedLock`, `lockForUpdate`, `insertGetId` was moved to `Query/Grammar`. (#76)
- Query/Builder::lock will now throw `BadMethodCallException` if called. Was ignored in previous versions. (#76)
- [Breaking Change] Commands are now only avaiable in cli mode (#81)
- Connections will now be closed after every job has been processed in the queue. (#80)

Refactored
- Rollback handling has been refactored to better readability. (#79)

# v4.7.0

Added
- Support `Blueprint::text` (translates to `STRING(MAX)`).

Chore
- Removed `ramsey/uuid` from composer.json since laravel already includes it.

Fixed
- Expressions given as $value in `Schema\Grammar::formatDefaultValue` will now go through `getValue` to match upstream (No behavioral change).

# v4.6.0

Fixed
- `Model::fresh` and `Model::refresh` now adds interleaved keys to the query.
- Remove Type declaration from `Query/Builder::forceIndex()` to match the one added to laravel/framework in `v9.52.0`.

# v4.5.0

Added
- Command `spanner:warmup` now has a new option `--skip-on-error` which will skip any connections which throws an exception.

Fixed
- Transaction state was not cleared if a NotFoundException was raised during rollback.

# v4.4.0

Added
- Support Schema\Builder::getAllTables()
- Command `spanner:cooldown` which clears all connections in the session pool.
- Command `spanner:warmup` now has a new option `--refresh` which will clear all existing sessions before warming up.

Changed
- Default SessionPool was changed from `Google\Cloud\Spanner\Session\CacheSessionPool` to `Colopl\Spanner\Session\CacheSessionPool` to patch an [unresolved issue on Google's end](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/issues/5567).

Fixed
- SessionPool was not cleared if php terminated immediately after calling `CacheSessionPool::clear`.

# v4.3.0

Added
- Support for default values in table columns.
- Command `spanner:sessions` which will list the sessions on the server side.
- Command `spanner:warmup` which warms up sessions upto minimum number set in config.

- Action classes for interleave and index for IDE auto-completion.
- `Blueprint::interleaveInParent()` was added and `Blueprint::interleave()` has been deprecated.
- `IndexDefinition::interleaveIn()` was added and `IndexDefinition::interleave()` has been deprecated.

Fixed

Chore
- Unnecessary folder depth has been flattened.

# v4.2.0

Fixed
- `Colopl\Spanner\Schema\Grammar::getDateFormat()` now returns `'Y-m-d\TH:i:s.uP'` instead of the default which does work correctly in Cloud Spanner. (43bffe630dbf765019674d12bf3ff3e768fe4022)
- `Colopl\Spanner\Schema\Grammar::wrapValue()` has been extracted as trait, so it can be shared with `Colopl\Spanner\Query\Grammar`. (2f4347942397b9197284f342e2a345bceec12402, ca8faa1db70934fd2809e00fbd640dd711e996f2)
